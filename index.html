            JMU Smart Spots is a project aimed to allow students an easy way of finding rooms, tables, or desks
            available in a given spot. The reserve page will allow students to select a room to reserve for a designated
            time or view if rooms are currently avaiable. The project consists of four teams: integration team, back end
            team, front end team, and center team. These teams collaborate with databases, hardware and user interfaces.
